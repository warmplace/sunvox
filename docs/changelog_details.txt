v2.0

=======
CONTROL
=======

There are two modes in the main SunVox windows (pattern, modules, timeline): selection and navigation.
Left mouse button = selection or navigation (depending on the mode).
Middle mouse button = navigation.
The default on desktops is selection.
Navigation is the default on mobile devices.
If Main menu -> Preferences -> Interface -> Control type = "Fingers", then SunVox will work like on a mobile device.

What if you need navigation but there is no middle mouse button?
macOS:
  * CMD + left button;
  * or install some application to emulate the middle button, for example Middle.
All systems:
  * there is middle button emulation on some touchpads: using three-finger click or by simultaneously pressing the left and right buttons (see the system touchpad settings);
  * switch between editing modes using the button with a selection rectangle;
  * if there is no such button, uncomment one of the show_sel_btn options in sunvox_config.ini;

General rules for all devices:
  * pressing with the stylus or finger is equivalent to pressing the left mouse button;
  * double click in an empty area - create a new object (if possible);
  * double-clicking on an object opens its properties (if possible);
  * scroll wheel - zoom in or scroll up/down;
  * right mouse button = menu;
  * SHIFT + left button = connect modules or disable snapping to the timeline grid;
  * CTRL + left button = multiple selection mode (previous selection is not cleared);

===========
SUPERTRACKS
===========

Since SunVox 2.0 there are two timeline modes: classic (default) and supertrack mode.
In classic mode, all patterns are independent - each has its own tracks inside.
In supertrack mode, the patterns can complement each other (interact) if they are on the same supertrack. Each supertrack is a set of 32 tracks that can be used by multiple patterns at the same time.
In supertrack mode, you can enable the "don't turn off notes at the end of the pattern" option: one short pattern can turn notes on, and another (on the same supertrack) turn it off.

===============
MAKE METAMODULE
===============

The selected modules can be packed into one MetaModule (see the menu of the module editor).
But the modules must conform to the following topology: TT -> SEL( IN -> ... ) -> R
TT - signal sources (optional) outside the selection;
SEL() - selected modules to be packed;
IN - receiving module (optional) inside the selection; at most one;
... - any modules inside the selection;
R - receiver (optional) that receives signals from modules within the selection; at most one.

=======================
DIALOG WINDOW SHORTCUTS
=======================

Y or ENTER = first button on the left;
N = last button on the right;
ESC = cancel;
1...9 = buttons from left to right;
