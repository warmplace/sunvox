v2.0

=======
CONTROL
=======

There are two modes in the main SunVox windows (pattern, modules, timeline): selection and navigation.
Left mouse button = selection or navigation (depending on the mode).
Middle mouse button = navigation.
The default on desktops is selection.
Navigation is the default on mobile devices.
If Main menu -> Preferences -> Interface -> Control type = "Fingers", then SunVox will work like on a mobile device.

What if you need navigation but there is no middle mouse button?
macOS:
  * CMD + left button;
  * or install some application to emulate the middle button, for example Middle.
All systems:
  * switch between editing modes using the button with a selection rectangle;
  * if there is no such button, uncomment one of the show_sel_btn options in sunvox_config.ini;

General rules for all devices:
  * pressing with the stylus or finger is equivalent to pressing the left mouse button;
  * double click in an empty area - create a new object (if possible);
  * double-clicking on an object opens its properties (if possible);
  * scroll wheel - zoom in or scroll up/down;
  * right mouse button = menu;
  * SHIFT + left button = connect modules or disable snapping to the timeline grid;
  * CTRL + left button = multiple selection mode (previous selection is not cleared);

===========
SUPERTRACKS
===========

Since v2.0, the timeline can work in an alternative supertrack mode (do not confuse with the tracks that are inside the pattern :)
Patterns on one supertrack control the same tracks: one pattern can complement the tracks of another.
A new pattern option "don't turn off notes at the end of the pattern" has been added: one short pattern can turn notes on, and another (on the same supertrack) turn it off.
